Challenges Repo

What is this repo all about?

This repository contains the very first bash and powershell scripts I have attempted while a student in the Ops program at Code Fellows Seattle. 

Why are you learning these skills?

Aside from being a part of the course curriculum, my interest in cyberops will undoubtedly include the need to automate processes, so beginning to explore this skillset only serves to enhance my ability to deliver high quality deliverables.

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?

1. Many ways to reach the summit: Though the outcomes for challenges and labs were the same for each of us, our paths to them usually differed. Sometimes these differences were amazingly different, reinforcing the notion that computing has flexibility in applying solutions to an issue or problem.

2. Context is key: In my professional life as a teacher of history and political science, I would always point out the power of context in establishing claims. By anchoring siutations in the respective who, what, where, when, so as to better arrive at how and why matters here too! For example, I have experienced one-off issues with elements of various labs that none of my classmates echoed. Sometimes, I just have the ghost in the machine.

3. My interest, peaked: I'm excited at the reacquisition of my childhood love of computers. What's even more exciting is feeling like I still have many things to learn and be exposed to so I can hone in on how to bring my interest towards passion.

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

I think my favorite is the last script I made where I feel I finally put the scripting concepts to use and with about 80% efficiency in completing it. I am not sure how much I'll end up doing in my career, but it is satisfying to learn and set the skill to work.

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

Automation will cut down on time something fierce, and can be used for rapid scaling up or down.

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?

I am in the process of converting my lessons into real applications in my home network environment first, and once I complete an analysis, I will begin implementing design updates.

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

I am looking forward to expanding out from one machine to an entire network via ops301.
