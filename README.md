```Challenges Repo```

This repository contains the very first bash and powershell scripts I have made and/or attempted while a student in the Ops program at Code Fellows Seattle. Aside from being a part of the course curriculum, my interest in cyberops will undoubtedly include the need to automate processes, so beginning to explore this skillset only serves to enhance my ability to deliver high quality deliverables.
